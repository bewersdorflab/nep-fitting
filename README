1) Run 'conda install -c barentine nep-fitting'
2) Close python and test installation by running 'STEDFitter' on the terminal, or by running 'dh5view', loading an
image, and selecting 'sted_psf_fitting' from the 'modules' drop-down menu.

To install using setuptools:

1) Clone this repository
2) Run 'python nep-fitting/setup.py install'
3) Run 'python nep-fitting/install_plugin.py'
4) Test installation by running 'dh5view', loading an image, and selecting 'sted_psf_fitting' from the 'modules'
